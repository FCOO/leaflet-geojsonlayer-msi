Submitting Issues
=================

Please note I don't mind helping when you run into trouble implementing this plugin, but to keep things nice for me too, just follow these simple guidelines when you do:

- First make sure you're not getting an error because of **same origin policy**!
- Check the [issues section](https://github.com/doedje/jquery.soap/issues/) and the [closed issues section](https://github.com/doedje/jquery.soap/issues?page=1&state=closed) to see if someone else already had your problem, if not
- Open an issue in the [issues section](https://github.com/doedje/jquery.soap/issues/) instead of sending me mail. This way others can learn from your case too! Please include the following:
	- the versions of your jquery and jquery.soap
	- your $.soap call
	- the request as sent to the server
	- the response from the server
- Being polite helps, especially when you want me to help you with _your_ problems. So please take the time to formulate something like a question. Opening an issue with just some code sniplets and error messages will be regarded as **unpolite** and will receive a ditto reply. 
(I just don't like receiving stuff like [issue #18](https://github.com/doedje/jquery.soap/issues/18) on a sunday)

_I also have a dayjob with deadlines and I'm a dad of two lovely little girls, so please understand I am not always able to reply to you asap..._

**Thanx for understanding!! =]**
